# baseballcz-scrappers

Set of scripts for scraping baseball.cz site.

## Getting started

To setup local environment run `pipenv install && pipenv shell` and than run either `python app.py` to start Flask api or `python cli.py` to run scrapper in your shell.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6
* Flask
* Requests
* BeatifulSoup 4

I would also recommend to use Pipenv to setup your environment.
